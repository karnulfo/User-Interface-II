       <p>I'm just tryina fill some words so ignore the following as it does not make sense at all: potato, pancakes, personification, filling, for, little, etcetera.Blablabla I was born in Texas but moved to
            El Salvador when I was a baby. Grow up in a spanish speaking country so even tho I was born here my main language is spanish. My brother is a computer scientist, maybe that's why I took this path as 
            well. I want to be financial independent. I want to have my own place and have my own privacy
